    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Vanilla Prompt Styles (Without LangChain)\n",
    "### Common types:\n",
    "- **Instruction Prompts** → Direct commands (e.g., \"Summarize this article in 3 bullet points\")\n",
    "- **Zero-Shot Prompts** → No examples, rely on model’s pretraining\n",
    "- **Few-Shot Prompts** → Provide a few examples before the query\n",
    "- **Chain-of-Thought Prompts** → Encourage reasoning step by step\n",
    "- **Role-Based Prompts** → Assign persona (e.g., \"You are a Python tutor…\")\n",
    "- **Contextual Prompts** → Provide background info before asking\n",
    "- **Conversational Prompts** → Simulate dialogue with alternating turns\n",
    "- **Multimodal Prompts** → Text + image/audio/video (if supported)\n",
    "\n",

    "## 3. Why LangChain?\n",
    "- **Challenge with vanilla prompts:**\n",
    "  - Hard to maintain consistency across applications\n",
    "  - No built-in validation → errors if placeholders are missing\n",
    "  - Difficult to reuse prompts across projects\n",
    "  - Managing multi-turn conversations is messy\n",
    "- **LangChain solves these problems by:**\n",
    "  - Providing structured classes (`PromptTemplate`, `ChatPromptTemplate`)\n",
    "  - Adding validation and error-checking\n",
    "  - Enabling reusability (save/load templates)\n",
    "  - Integrating prompts seamlessly with chains and workflows\n",
    "  - Supporting advanced features like role-based messages and dynamic chat history\n",
    "- **Most reasonable reason to use LangChain:**  \n",
    "  It transforms *ad-hoc experimentation* into *production-ready workflows* with clarity, consistency, and context management.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. LangChain Prompt Types \n",
    "- **Static Prompts** → Hardcoded text (simple, but error-prone)\n",
    "- **Dynamic Prompts** → Templates with placeholders (flexible, consistent)\n",
    "- **PromptTemplate Class** → Validation, reusability, integration\n",
    "- **ChatPromptTemplate** → Multi-turn conversations with role-based messages\n",
    "- **Message Types**:\n",
    "  - SystemMessage → sets assistant’s role/context\n",
    "  - HumanMessage → user input\n",
    "  - AIMessage → model response\n",
    "- **MessagePlaceholder** → Insert chat history dynamically at runtime\n",
