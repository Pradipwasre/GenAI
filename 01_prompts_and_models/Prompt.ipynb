    "## 1. Warm-Up & Context\n",
    "- Why prompts matter in GenAI\n",
    "- Small changes → big differences in outputs\n",
    "- Prompt Engineering as an emerging skill/job role\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Vanilla Prompt Styles (Without LangChain)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Techniques \n",
    "1. **Instruction Prompts** → Direct commands (e.g., \"Summarize this article in 3 bullet points\") \n",
    "2. **Zero‑Shot Prompts** → No examples, rely on model’s pretraining \n",
    "3. **Few‑Shot Prompts** → Provide a few examples before the query \n",
    "4. **Chain‑of‑Thought Prompts** → Encourage reasoning step by step \n",
    "5. **Role‑Based Prompts** → Assign persona (e.g., \"You are a Python tutor…\") \n",
    "6. **Deliberate (Self‑Consistency) Prompts** → Multiple reasoning paths → consistent answer \n",
    "7. **Prompt Chaining** → Sequential prompts → step‑by‑step workflow \n",
    "8. **ReAct Prompts (Reason + Act)** → Combine reasoning + tool actions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Techniques \n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Contextual Prompts** → Provide background info before asking \n",
    "10. **Conversational Prompts** → Simulate dialogue with alternating turns \n",
    "11. **Multimodal Prompts** → Combine text + image/audio/video (if supported) \n",
    "12. **RAG (Retrieval‑Augmented Generation) Prompts** → Connect LLMs with external knowledge bases\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Why LangChain?\n",
    "- **Challenge with vanilla prompts:**\n",
    "  - Hard to maintain consistency across applications\n",
    "  - No built-in validation → errors if placeholders are missing\n",
    "  - Difficult to reuse prompts across projects\n",
    "  - Managing multi-turn conversations is messy\n",
    "- **LangChain solves these problems by:**\n",
    "  - Providing structured classes (`PromptTemplate`, `ChatPromptTemplate`)\n",
    "  - Adding validation and error-checking\n",
    "  - Enabling reusability (save/load templates)\n",
    "  - Integrating prompts seamlessly with chains and workflows\n",
    "  - Supporting advanced features like role-based messages and dynamic chat history\n",
    "- **Most reasonable reason to use LangChain:**  \n",
    "  It transforms *ad-hoc experimentation* into *production-ready workflows* with clarity, consistency, and context management.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. LangChain Prompt Types \n",
    "- **Static Prompts** → Hardcoded text (simple, but error-prone)\n",
    "- **Dynamic Prompts** → Templates with placeholders (flexible, consistent)\n",
    "- **PromptTemplate Class** → Validation, reusability, integration\n",
    "- **ChatPromptTemplate** → Multi-turn conversations with role-based messages\n",
    "- **Message Types**:\n",
    "  - SystemMessage → sets assistant’s role/context\n",
    "  - HumanMessage → user input\n",
    "  - AIMessage → model response\n",
    "- **MessagePlaceholder** → Insert chat history dynamically at runtime\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 📖 Definition\n",
    "Zero-Shot Prompting is a technique where a **Large Language Model (LLM)** is asked to perform a task **without being given any examples or demonstrations** in the prompt.  \n",
    "- The model relies entirely on its **pretrained knowledge** and **general understanding** of language and concepts.  \n",
    "- This approach is part of **Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL)**, where AI systems solve tasks they haven’t been explicitly trained on, using prior knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  How It Works\n",
    "1. **Direct Instruction** → The user provides a clear command or query.  \n",
    "2. **No Examples Provided** → Unlike few-shot prompting, the model is not shown sample inputs/outputs.  \n",
    "3. **Model Generalization** → The LLM uses its **internal training data** and **generalization ability** to infer the correct response.  \n",
    "4. **Output Generation** → The model produces an answer based purely on prior knowledge, without external guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Why It Matters\n",
    "- **Efficiency** → No need to craft multiple examples; saves time.  \n",
    "- **Flexibility** → Works across diverse tasks (classification, summarization, translation, etc.).  \n",
    "- **Scalability** → Useful when examples are unavailable or impractical to provide.  \n",
    "- **Demonstrates Generalization** → Shows how LLMs can apply knowledge to new, unseen tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Use Cases\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis** → *“Classify the sentiment of: ‘I love this product.’”*  \n",
    "- **Text Summarization** → *“Summarize this article in 3 bullet points.”*  \n",
    "- **Translation** → *“Translate this sentence into French.”*  \n",
    "- **Q&A** → *“What is the capital of Japan?”*  \n",
    "- **Content Generation** → *“Write a short poem about the ocean.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Key Insights\n",
    "- Zero-Shot Prompts highlight the **power of pretraining** in LLMs.  \n",
    "- They are best for **simple, well-known tasks** where the model’s training already covers the concept.  \n",
    "- For **complex or domain-specific tasks**, few-shot or chain-of-thought prompting may yield better accuracy.  \n",

      "**Reason:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To multiply two numbers, we need to follow the steps of the multiplication algorithm. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, we multiply each digit of the second number (47) by the first number (23). Here's how we do it: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Multiply 23 by 40 (the tens digit of 47): \n",
      "  - 23 × 40 = 920 (since 40 is 4 tens, it is the same as 23 × 4 × 10)\n",
      "  - Keep track of the tens place\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Multiply 23 by 7 (the ones digit of 47):\n",
      "  - 23 × 7 = 161 \n",
      "\n",
      "Now we need to add the numbers we got in steps 1 and 2, while considering their places:\n",
      "- We add 920 (from the tens place) and 0 (because 161 is less than 23 × 10, thus not carrying) to it, which will result in 920.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Now add 100 (the tens digit of 23 × 40 shifted by one place) and 61 (the ones digit of the 161 multiplied by 7)\n",
      "This yields 1000 + 980 + 161 which is the same as (980 + 161) + (1000). \n",
      "So  the result is 1141  or 1381.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the multiplication problem 23 × 47 is the same as the multiplication of the tens digits  (2 × 4) plus tens place shifted  2 × 7 or (2 × 7) (2× 0), plus (2 x7) plus the ones place shifted of  2 × 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result we're looking for should be found by shifting the last calculation of 2 × 7, one position so 2 × 7 shifted should actually be 2 × 70  as we're shifting the numbers 2 × 4 and  2 × 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 × 70 + 2 × 7 = 140 + 14 \n",
      "Since this is not the correct operation that we need to solve the equation, we instead multiply (2 × 4) (23) by the number 10 since 4 is 4 tens. We get 2× 4  × 10 which is  80 + (2 × 4  × 10) and (23) with the number 7 (which results in, 161). The equation (2 ×  7) with the shifted 100  from previous equation becomes (80+161)+((20+2)*7=1000+920+ 21) or the original numbers  and just shift the multiplication 2 × 7 by 1 position in order for the 2×10 and the 7 in 23 × 70 to equal out with multiplication (2  ×  7) 23  shifted which actually equals 1610 + (20 + (40)) 7  or more properly (23  × 7 shifted) plus 10 and 20 ( 20 + 2  * 7). We can instead take ( (2× 4) with the tens shifted to get (2 ×  4) ×  10) as (2 × 4) with a shifted tens place of ten  or (2 × 40) or 80. Now with the equation (2 ×  40)  or 80 + 161, which is shifted to 920 and the original equation of (2 × 7) with  a shifted 100 or 23 × 40. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since we had 920 + (20 + 2)* 7 (or 920 +  21) we should multiply the tens place by 10. In this case the 2  * 40. Then we multiply by (2  * 7 shifted) or the original (23 * 70)  and add it to the number 23 × 40 (which is 920)  which results in (920 + 2 × 7  × 10)(2 × 40 with the shifted 10) which will give us 920 +  2×70 (which is 140 + 20). In this step the calculation of the numbers in the equation ( 920 + (20 + 2) *7) or ( 920 +  21) is actually  2 × 70 shifted (or the  2 × 70  as 140 and 20) in order for this calculation to be correct: The  920 shifted  10 or (20) + (2 * 7 shifted by 10) in order for the numbers in equation 920 + (2*70) shifted by  21.\n"

      "Loops are a fundamental concept in programming that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. In this example, we'll use a simple print loop to demonstrate how loops work.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Basic Syntax\n",
      "\n",
      "In Python, there are two main types of loops:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **For Loop**: This loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance.\n",
      "2. **While Loop**: This loop is used when you don't know the number of iterations in advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### For Loop\n",
      "\n",
      "A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, etc.) or other iterable objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example: Print the numbers from 1 to 5\n",
      "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
      "for fruit in fruits:\n",
      "    print(fruit)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, we have a list of fruits. The `for` loop iterates over each item in the list and prints it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The loop starts at the beginning of the list.\n",
      "2. It assigns the first item (`'apple'`) to the variable `fruit`.\n",
      "3. It executes the `print(fruit)` statement.\n",
      "4. It moves on to the next item in the list (`'banana'`) and repeats the process.\n",
      "5. It continues until it reaches the end of the list (`'cherry'`).\n",
      "\n",
      "### While Loop\n",
      "\n",
      "A while loop is used to repeat a block of code while a certain condition is met.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5\n",
      "i = 1\n",
      "while i <= 5:\n",
      "    print(i)\n",
      "    i += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, we have a while loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The loop starts with `i` set to 1.\n",
      "2. The condition `i <= 5` is evaluated. If it's true, the loop body is executed.\n",
      "3. The `print(i)` statement is executed with `i` set to 1.\n",
      "4. The `i += 1` statement increments `i` to 2.\n",
      "5. The loop body is repeated until the condition `i <= 5` is no longer true.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "* Use meaningful variable names.\n",
      "* Keep loops concise and focused on the task at hand.\n",
      "* Avoid excessive nesting of loops.\n",

    "\n",
    "####  Definition\n",
    "RAG Prompting is a technique where the **Large Language Model (LLM)** is combined with an **external knowledge source** (such as a database, document store, or search engine).  \n",
    "- The model retrieves relevant information first.  \n",
    "- Then it generates a response using both the retrieved data and its own reasoning.  \n",
    "- This ensures answers are **accurate, up‑to‑date, and grounded in external facts**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "####  How It Works\n",
    "1. **User Query** → The user asks a question.  \n",
    "2. **Retrieval Step** → The system searches external sources (documents, APIs, web).  \n",
    "3. **Augmentation Step** → Retrieved information is fed into the prompt.  \n",
    "4. **Generation Step** → The LLM produces a final answer using both context + knowledge.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Why It Matters\n",
    "- **Accuracy** → Reduces hallucinations by grounding answers in real data.  \n",
    "- **Freshness** → Provides up‑to‑date information beyond the model’s training cutoff.  \n",
    "- **Domain Adaptation** → Useful for specialized fields (medicine, law, finance).  \n",
    "- **Trustworthiness** → Responses can be traced back to sources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Use Cases\n",
    "- **Customer Support** → Retrieve FAQs or manuals, then generate tailored answers.  \n",
    "- **Education** → Pull from textbooks or lecture notes to answer student queries.  \n",
